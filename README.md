# Welcome to the Guide for Software Installation for Computer Vision

This guide will help you install a list of required software and libraries for Computer Vision and Deep Learning development on Ubuntu.

The name of the script is `required_libraries.sh`.

## Steps to Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Type the following command and press `Enter`:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/danyalwg/Deep-Learning-Libraries-Auto-Install.git
```

and press `Enter`. You'll now be in the directory of the cloned repository.

### Running the Script:

1. Before running the script, you need to make sure that it has the necessary permissions. In the terminal, type the following command:
```sh
cd Desktop/Deep-Learning-Libraries-Auto-Install
```

and press `Enter`. You'll now be in the directory of the cloned repository.

### Running the Script:

1. Before running the script, you need to make sure that it has the necessary permissions. In the terminal, type the following command:


```sh
chmod +x required_libraries.sh
```

and press `Enter`. This command changes the script to be executable, which means you can now run it.

2. Now, to run the script, type:


```sh
./required_libraries.sh
```

and press `Enter`. 

The script will now begin running. Depending on your system's speed and the current state of installed software, it may take some time to complete. 

Please note that this script requires administrator (sudo) access, and will run commands as such. It is important to only run scripts as administrator if they are from a trusted source, as they have high-level access to your system.

Remember: You can stop the script at any time by pressing 'Ctrl+C' in the terminal.

In case of any error messages or if the script fails to run, make sure the command was typed correctly, and that the `required_libraries.sh` script is indeed in the directory you navigated to.
